# 🪑 Portable Desk for Low-Resource Schools

This project was developed as part of my **International Baccalaureate (IB) Certification**, with a strong focus on **social impact through engineering design**.

The goal was to create a **functional, low-cost, and ergonomic portable desk** for students in underserved educational environments. Designed entirely in **Onshape**, this desk is optimized for ease of assembly, affordability, and durability.
